                embroidery logo?</strong></p>
        <p id="9e52354a-fc9c-4ce8-bca2-d4d4c6779811" class="">Brand awareness can be achieved with many ways such as
            packaging, cart work, labels…. Yet the the embroidery logo could be the easiest and cheapest one thanks to
            long-lasting as long as the product in use.
            Though it seems easy to be applied but technically many aspect must be respected in order to be able to get
            the full benefits of embroidery logo.
            It is not applicable in any fabric because each fabric has some features that differentiate it and the
            application of logo could be wrong idea.
            Instead of branding, you would end up deforming the logo and your product would look unstylish and
            unattractive especially in elastic fabric though it is a good fabric to produce products from. Because of
            big amount of wastage, price… it is not feasible with such fabrics.
            The size of logo can determine the application of the logo for branding. The small the logo is the better
            product pricing you get.
            Choosing the right logo size and fabric would definitely help you brand with logo in your product at a cheap
            cost.</p>
