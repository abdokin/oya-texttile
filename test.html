    Records suggest that more than 80 pounds of used clothes are thrown away in the US. A major chunk of this weight is clothes made from cotton. It is a hassle to dispose of the cotton once it is used as it can lead to more environmental problems. This cotton can be used in a number of ways so that hassles of its disposal can be eliminated. At <a href="http://pestemal.com/">Pestemal.com</a>, we have taken care of this issue as the recycled cotton yarns will be used in the manufacturing of our new towels line. Our professionally trained experts have come up with an effective way to use recycled cotton yarns and turn them into quality towels.</li></ol><ol type="1" id="f6484e85-1990-4aae-b972-26dbd6098e64" class="numbered-list" start="5"><li>Durable
    Many people are of the view that products made from recycled components do not tend to have a longer shelf life. However, this is not true in the case of our regenerated towels. They can last for a longer period of time as only quality ingredients are slated to be used in their manufacturing. This will make more cost-efficient as you won’t have to buy a new towel every now and then. Although they may not have the same durability as that of organic cotton towels; however, it is guaranteed that they will not lose their sheen and look after a short period of time.</li></ol></div></article>
